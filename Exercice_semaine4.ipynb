    "Using the usual Vahatra dataframe of protected areas (PAs) in Madagascar (containing all protected areas), perform the following tasks: \n",

    "1. Fit an OLS model with the deforestation rate over the period 2000 - 2023 as your response variable and predictors corresponding to a quadratic polynomial function of the year of creation of the protected area (year of creation + year of creation squared).\n",
    "2. Print a summary of the results and compare the R-squared of this OLS model to the R-squared of the OLS model you fitted last week with the year of creation as your single predictor variable. What do you observe?\n",
    "3. Next compare these two models using a F-test with the anova_lm() function. What do you observe?\n",
    "4. Now create a dummy variable equal to 1 if a PA belongs to IUCN category I or II and to 0 otherwise. Fit an OLS model with this new variable as your predictor and the deforestation rate over the period 2000 - 2023 as the response variable. Print the summary table of results. What do you observe?\n",
    "5. Finally, fit an OLS model with the year of creation and the IUCN category I or II dummy as your two predictors. Print the results and perform a F-test comparing this model to the model with the year of creation as the single predictor. What do you observe? Why do you think this is the case?\n"
